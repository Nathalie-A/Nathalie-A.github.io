							<p>„To: Cameron” is a Serious Game in which the players take the role of Cameron, who’s grounded without internet access over the whole winter break. Her family doesn’t know that the teenager just became aware that she’s a lesbian. To keep it that way, Cameron’s only chance of talking about her newly found feelings and questions with her friends is through paper plane-letters that her friends sneak into her home at night. She has to find these letters before her parents do.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Here we have very exiting code that showcases how I included a very special way to make the player walk without having any animations for the player sprite which is super special and exiting and I am indeed showing it off here to my left so you can see what I did and yea that's basically it very good very exiting and so on jada jada jada cool ok I'll leave.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Here to my righr we have a picture or maybe hopefully a gif that showplays how I it looks ingame so yea that it pretty awesome and cool as well so uhm yea.</p>
