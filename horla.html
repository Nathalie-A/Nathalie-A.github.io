							<p>The idea of the game comes from the novelle "The Horla" (1886) by Guy de Maupassant. The story gets told in the form of a diary and is about the unnamend protagonist with schizophrenia, who lived in france in the same year as the book was published. The Walking Simulator will lead you through few days of the protagonists life.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Here we have very exiting code that showcases how I included a very special way to make the player walk without having any animations for the player sprite which is super special and exiting and I am indeed showing it off here to my left so you can see what I did and yea that's basically it very good very exiting and so on jada jada jada cool ok I'll leave.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Here to my righr we have a picture or maybe hopefully a gif that showplays how I it looks ingame so yea that it pretty awesome and cool as well so uhm yea.</p>	
							<p>Here is the Link to the game and the repo so you can check the code out yourself. Also underneath is maybe hopefully a playthrough video.</p>
