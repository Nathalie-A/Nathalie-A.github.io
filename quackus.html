							<p>Our hero Quackus Duckus just has arrived in his home town Ducking Village as he received a tinder message from Schleifischwan von Schwaningen. She told him: "ono Quackus bae them Geese from Goosehood be trashin' ma Louis Vuitton handbags" and just like every basic hero, Quackus could not ignore a damsel in distress. So thus, our hero makes himself on the way to the very not evil tower Gaensebluemchenturm.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Here we have very exiting code that showcases how I included a very special way to make the player walk without having any animations for the player sprite which is super special and exiting and I am indeed showing it off here to my left so you can see what I did and yea that's basically it very good very exiting and so on jada jada jada cool ok I'll leave.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Here to my righr we have a picture or maybe hopefully a gif that showplays how I it looks ingame so yea that it pretty awesome and cool as well so uhm yea.</p>	
							<p>Here is the Link to the game and the repo so you can check the code out yourself. Also underneath is maybe hopefully a playthrough video.</p>
